Git commands:

We can create a repo from github and clone it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wspawned/test-folder-repo.git
```

Check git status.
```bash
git status
```
We can add new files or create a new React project under that file, later we can upload new files with git add.
For specific files.
```bash
git add .\README.md
```
For all files.
```bash
git add .   
```
After staging the changes we can create a commit.
```bash
git commit -m"This is the commit msg"   
```
Last step, push.
```bash
git push  
```
This is a code sample:
```js
console.log("Hello there");
```
